2022
19 May - Rebuild under Qt 5.15.3 on KUbuntu 22.04.
17 May - Commited and pushed some modifications to peripheral files.
16 May - Created repository on Github and uploaded files.
2015
14 May - Modified list display code to use sethtml instead of the earlier conversion to Utf8. This preserves
     user locale and enable umlauts to be displayed. The other editors were already using sethtml.
     Also modified the insert image code to put the absolute path to the html file from the data
     directory .cryptdj, instead of the ":" shortcut, which is not working in the 32-bit version.
2014
20 November - Backport of 4-0.1 richtext to 3-0.3.
20 October - Fixed the notes search code to strip away the HTML markup before looking for the search string.
17 October - The check for zero-length rich text will always fail due to the embedded HTML markup which is not
    displayed in the editor. To check for empty notes or lists, convert to plaintext and then find the length.
14 October - After converting editors to rich text, exporting the notes and lists to text was also adding all
    the HTML markup to the exported files. Fixed by using a QTextDocument to read in the HTML and convert
    to plain text.
13 October - Added font selector and font size controls to toolbar. Added code to correctly indicate on the
    toolbar the format of the text when the cursor position is changed.
10 October - Added a toolbar and converted the three editors from plaintext to rich text.
    set_contact was scrambling the contact tree labels if the contact tab was hidden and a contact
    below a category was directly clicked. Made the tab visible first. Seems to have fixed it.
5 September - Removed all old references to fltk and conversion of FLTK based data. This one is completely Qt.
12 August - Modified the Homepath to the data subdirectory under Linux and Windows. It now contains the
     full path to the data subdirectory.
     It is set once at the beginning of the program and then used everywhere.
     Modified conversion code also to access the new variables.
     A #define is used for TESTING. This accesses a dummy data directory called .tdjtest, instead
     of using the working data directory.
7 August - Added compiler directives to acquire the USERPROFILE environment variable for running under
     Windows, in place of the HOME environment variable under Linux. This is stored in a string called Homepath.
     Also the conversion of data from fltdj2 to tdj3 is now done only under Linux.
4 July - Fixed code to display the daily repeating and non-repeating appointments.
     Added a new class used to sort the rows in the appointments table.
2 July - Added a checkbox to the first column in appointments table. This is to indicate that the
     appointment repeats everyday. Repeating appointments are stored in a separate file.
     Added tooltips to the appointment and anniversary tables.
2013
27 December - Bug in formatting the calendar date which grayed out the background for notes with
     data. Empty notes seem to have a length of 1. Why? Fixed.
26 December - Added a preference and associated code to select the calendar header color.
24 December - Added a preference and associated code to show and remove grid lines in the calendar between dates.
     Added a preference to show or remove the week numbers in the leftmost column.
     Changed some of the key assignments to avoid repeated letters.
20 December - Added code to sort the anniversaries in the order in which they occur. As in the case of the
     To-Do list, any additions or changes while the program runs will be unsorted, but get sorted the next
     time it is executed.
31 October - Added code to sort the To-do list when it is first read from file. Any additions to the list
     while the program runs will be unsorted, but get sorted the next time it is executed.
     Also added a signal to show both the To-do and Contact list after pressing the enter key when it is highlighted.
     This enables moving up and down the list using the cursor keys.
21 August - Debugged alarm related code. Seems to work.
20 August - In the menu Help/Help callback, added searchpath variable that specifies location of resources.
     This helps in display of images within the help file.
     Added functions to issue alarms 5 minutes before appointments.
14 August - Tuned new category and contact messages.
     Added code to trap the Alt-F4 keypress that terminates the application. This will call save_and_quit
     like Alt-File-Exit.
     Ready to roll? Perhaps.
13 August - Debugged the logic of the code which colors the date background. The order matters, and only the first
     call should color the date with the default background, if needed. The later calls overwrite the
     previous ones.
     Adjusted layout of the Search tab.
12 August - Added a button below the calendar displaying today's date and which switches the calendar to today
     when clicked.
     Added code to color dates having notes with a lightgray background.
     Added code to display the currently selected date on the status bar.
8 August - Added a check for the fltdj2 and qtdj2 subdirs at program start. The qtdj2 subdir is created
     if absent. If the fltdj2 subdir is present the program does a conversion of the old data.
     It reads files from the .fltdj2 subdir and writes the data to the .qtdj2 subdirectory in the
     current format. Works. However, the old appointment data (from 2000) onwards is lost, since fltdj2 does
     not read the fltdj1 format. New appointments stored using fltdj2	seem to convert properly.
     The contacts, lists and anniversaries seem to convert without problems.
     Added code to color the days having appointments with a cyan background. For days with both holidays
     and appointments (rare!) the appointment color superceded the holiday color.
6 August - Rearranged prefs tab to create a vbox. This contains the weekstart radiobutton set,
     the tabstart radiobutton set, as well as the fortune and font buttons. The weekstart and
     tabstart are also vboxes. The mouse selection works!
     Added code to search appointments and append results in search box.
5 August - Bug is radiobutton logic in the search tab.
     They do not respond to mouse clicks, but respond to hot-keys.
     Added code to paint anniversaries with a yellow background.
     Added code to selecte the date for the second anniversary column from a drop down table.
2 August - Bug in search logic was erasing everything except the results obtained from the last notes
     file because the text browser was being cleared within the loop. Fixed.
     Added a drop down combo box to the month column of the anniversary table, using a code snippet
     from:
     http://qt-project.org/wiki/Combo_Boxes_in_Item_Views.
     Works like a charm!
     Added logic in get_anniversary_items to skip over blank entries.
1 August - Restructured tabcontainer to contain empty widgets, which are then filled with the rest
     of the interface items.
     Added a checkbox and the associated code to set the preference for seeing the output from
     fortune. It will be displayed in notes that are blank.
     Added a layout to the preferences tab.
     Added a button to bring up a font-selector dialog, and to save and restore the selected
     font as a user preference.
     Added code to check for a lockfile at program start, and to create one while running, and
     deleting it when the program terminates. The user gets a notification if a lockfile is
     detected when the program starts, and is given an opportunity to continue or abort.
     Added keyboard shortcuts to all the widgets.
31 July - Debugged search code for notes.
     Added a window to show the copyright and GNU license file, and a help window to show the
     user manual.
     Empty Notes files were being created even when no data was present. Traced to failure to
     clear note data structures prior to reading the notes files. Fixed.
30 July - Now the last column stretches to fill the avaialable space in both tables.
     The anniversary table checks the month to ensure it lies between 1 and 12.
     Added a search tab, with a search text box. Added code to read and search notes.
     Contains bugs.
     Added the home environment. The program will read and write data to .qtdj2 subdirectory
     in the home account.
29 July - Added a Preferences tab, and a preferences source file to the project.
     Added widgets and code to set the first day of the week to be either Sun or Mon.
     Added a delete button for the lists.
     Added code to create, delete, read and write lists under the lists tab.
26 July - Added code to read and write contacts data.
     Added code to modify tree and tab size when the window size changes. Added minimum height and width
     to limit the smallest size of the window.
     Added code to save and restore the program position and window size.
     Debugged code to write and read back notes and contacts. Converted i/o streams from text to data.
25 July - You need to set the current item to get the proper parent-child relationship!
     Added a delete button for the contacts. Tree code seems to be working.
     Added a status bar to display intelligent messages.
24 July - Added buttons to insert new categories and contacts.
23 July - Experimented with layouts and resizing in Designer. Keeping things as they are for the
     moment.
22 July - Bug in checking appointment data altered column entries. This was due to not ascertaining
     whether col == 1 in the else-clause of the if-condition in save_app. Fixed.
     Added code to fix the width of the description column in appts and anniverss.
     Need to use layouts to improve the appearance of the UI.
     Added the tree-related data and a box for the tree container in the UI.
19 July - Converting data format of notes, anniversaries and appointments and saving
     each into a separate file.
18 July - Added anniversaries table and associated code. The table filling and retrieval code
     has quite a lot of bugs.
17 July - Split journal and appt data i/o into a separate file.
16 July - Value returned by QString.size does not take into account the end NULL character.
     Program segfaulted on displaying the notes. Fixed by increasing the memory
     allocation for the note to include the NULL.
     Added  code to fill and display the appointments. Many bugs.
15 July - Added the appointments tab and some related code.
12 July - Formal beginning. Coded the mainwindow, calendar, tab container, and notes tab.
