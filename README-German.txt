The German language version has been contributed by Tim H. Scheit (timh@taunusstein.net)

Tim has translated all the user-visible text in the program into German. The translation
file, tdj4_de.qm, is automatically loaded at run time and presents the user-interface
in the German language for users whose computers have been configured for that locale.

If you have any feedback, comments or suggestions regarding the translations, Tim will be happy
to discuss it with you. Please communicate directly with him via email.
